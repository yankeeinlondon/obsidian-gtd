# Kind Model Plugin

> `obsidian-kind-model`

## Overview

This repo is a plugin for the popular [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) editor and extends it's functionality to produce "kinded models" of entities you want to represent in your PKM.

The **kind** definitions are nothing more than markdown files in your vault which conform to a particular naming convention for Frontmatter properties. Knowing this convention is actually unimportant to start as you can design your ken entities using the configuration tab in Obsidian:

## What's so good about a Kind?

Ok so I can define a **kind**. Why should I care? What does it do? Before we lose you -- ye of little faith -- let's cover a couple of the top benefits:

- **Classification**

  You can classify any _kinded_ page with a few different classification schemes. The default is category/subcategory which allows you to associate each kinded page with a "category" and a more specific "sub-category".

  A _kinded_ entity doesn't need to classify itself but by doing so it creates a link to a page which then shows the aggregation of all pages which share this classification. This _abstracted_ relationship is often more powerful than just a direct relationship as it not only helps contextualize in it's own right it provides an easily navigable solution for discovery (aka, what things are related to my current thing).

- **Direct Relationships**

  While classification provides a nice way to contextualize a _kinded page_ and identify peers of that entity, it's often important to draw out direct relationships between one entity and another. Importantly, a direct relationship can be between two pages of _the same kind_ but often it is a means to map one kind of page to another.

- **Metrics**

  Metrics are data points which we capture in life. They are always _numeric_ and they always relate to some sort of _unit of measure_(UOM). With this plugin, you can express which metrics a particular kind can capture and what UOM should be assumed. What's nice about this is that not only are authors of a given page able to be reminded of the precise metrics that are available to the page but when you are looking at a query across an aggregation of this kind you can see the same metrics reported back to you.

All three of these are covered in greater detail in the sections below.
